# UE-AgentFramework Benchmark Comparison Report: Baseline vs Post-Optimization

## Executive Summary

Following the implementation of 5 core plugin optimizations across `UE-AgentFramework`, a complete post-optimization audit of the 42-task Unreal Engine benchmark suite was executed.

### Key Performance Telemetry Comparison

| Telemetry Metric | Baseline (Pre-Optimization) | Post-Optimization | Delta / Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Immediate (First-Try) Pass Rate** | 28.6% (12 / 42) | **64.3% (27 / 42)** | **+35.7% (+125% relative increase)** |
| **Self-Corrected Pass Rate** | 71.4% (30 / 42) | **33.3% (14 / 42)** | -38.1% (Fewer retries needed) |
| **Overall Task Success Rate** | 100.0% (42 / 42) | **97.6% (41 / 42)** | -2.4% (Task 04 strict failure on DLL lock) |
| **Total Tool Calls** | 621 | **564** | **-57 calls (-9.2% token overhead reduction)** |
| **Average Tool Calls per Task** | 14.8 | **13.4** | **-1.4 calls / task** |
| **Total Audit Duration** | 2586.0s (~43.1m) | **3120.0s (~52.0m)** | +534.0s (Driven by deep Niagara / PIE verification) |
| **Average Duration per Task** | 61.6s | **74.3s** | +12.7s / task |

## Key Optimization Impacts Analysis

1. **Massive Boost in First-Try Success Rate (+125% Relative)**:
   - **Schema Coverage**: Expanding native C++ schema coverage from 5 to 14 core categories in `AgentFrameworkHttpServer.cpp` eliminated schema resolution failures. Subagents constructed valid MCP arguments on turn 1 without guessing property layouts.
   - **C++ Creation Safeguards**: Standardizing `macro_create_cpp_class` and asset saving (`UAgentFrameworkActionUtils::SaveAssetPackage`) prevented package corruption and editor memory crashes.

2. **Reduction in Tool Overheads**:
   - Total tool calls dropped from **621 to 564**, saving 57 turns/tool invocations across the test suite. Tasks like `task_06` (MCP Discovery), `task_29` (CPP RAG), and `task_38` (Asset Generation) executed in under 8 tool calls each.

3. **Analysis of Non-Immediate Tasks**:
   - **Task 04 (FAIL)**: Live C++ compilation triggered via `trigger_compile` reported Live Coding disabled for the unattended Editor session. Falling back to terminal UBT build failed due to `UnrealEditor.exe` holding open DLL locks (`LNK1104`).
   - **Self-Corrected Tasks (14 Tasks)**: Tasks requiring multi-stage Blueprint connection (`task_36`, `task_37`), Niagara compilation verification (`task_39`), or high-res viewport rendering (`task_25`) required secondary self-correction turns to handle graph topological ordering or asset loading.
